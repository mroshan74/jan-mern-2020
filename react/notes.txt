*** 18-02-2020 React Components

anything that is rendered once with react will not re-render even the variable value is changed, so we will have to re-render the component again
setTimeOut( call back function(){},time )  called only once
setInterval( call back function(){},time)  called after again every time interval

function and class Components
class components has something to do with behavior and events
function components more into display of components like information to the user, meant for presentation

React - 2013
jS - classes - 2015 -react 16

class in React

class <name> extends React.Component{
    render (){ // must return render component // if not it will throw an error
        return 
    }
}

Difference between states and props?

parameter of setState is prevState- can be called anything, but its preferred to be called prevState
but this.state the state variable cannot be changed.

// es6 - object destructuring----------------
const user = {
    firstName : 'roshan',
    email: 'rosh@gmail.com'
}

const { firstName, email } = user
console.log(firstName, email)----------------------//

function cant re render but class can
this.state is an object. why? => to store multiple values that can be assigned
